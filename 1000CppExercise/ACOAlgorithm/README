Study and Implementation of Ant Colony Algorithms

This project deals with the implementation of various ant colony algorithms.

Currently 3 variants have been implemented:

1. Simple ACO
2. Elitist ACO
3. Rank Based ACO

Files included:

output.py - script for running the three variants and displaying the output.
readfiles.py - contains scripts for plotting the output for the TSP (requires matplotlib)
antal.cpp - S-ACO implementation
antalElitist.cpp- Elitist ACO implementation
antalRank.cpp - Rank based ACO implementation

Compiled on Ubuntu 12.04 with g++.

Note:

1. You may run either the individual implementations or simply run the output.py script
2. TSPConstructor creates a 30 city TSP.
